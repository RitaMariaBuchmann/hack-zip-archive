A bit of a strange question, but is there no tool for finding out a Winzip archive password that finds the password using the following method:

The password is for example: Fred92113!!
…..then the program could search for the first symbol, i.e. “F”, and once it has found that, then the program could search for the second symbol, i.e. “r”, etc.

Personally, I think the Dictionary Attack thing is pretty bullshit and might be effective for some attacks.

Is there such a script?
